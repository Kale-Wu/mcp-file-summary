# mcp-si-summary
An MCP (Model Context Protocol) tool for getting system info on the local device.

Tested on [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download). To use, paste config file in this repo to the Claude Desktop config file. (Claude Desktop > File > Settings > Developper > Edit Config > claude_desktop_config.json). Then activate tool and allow access when prompted by Claude. Claude should automatically call the tool when a prompt suggests that knowing the user's system information (CPU, GPU, disk space, network info, os, etc.) would be useful.
